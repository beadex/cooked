## Cooked

Greetings, chefs.

For all these years,  I myself was very intuitive to use those cookers like create-react-app or vue-cli. They are good cookers, but really redundant and cumbersome at some point.

When comes to Webpack, I myself, once again, was excited about the powers I got on controlling my project, my build, and my package. Configure Webpack and build process is a fun thing to do, too. That is the point I got my own branded cookers. Sharp, solid, and very handy.

At work (I mean both my main works and side, personal works), I have to create a quite amount of projects every month, from time to time. It's a frustrating workflow when copy the pasta all over the place and splitting it to smaller plates to serve. I need a more modern, convenient, and smarter solution.

That, I come to Node CLI. And "cooked" born.

Cooked, a small and easy-to-use CLI cooker to cook some Node project spaghetti templates. It had React, Vue with Webpack boilerplates, Express templates, and many more to come in the near future.

All in one place and ready to use right on your quickie fingers.

### Usage

The one and only mighty command:

`$ cook`

Follow the guide and you will be there.

Happy cooking!
